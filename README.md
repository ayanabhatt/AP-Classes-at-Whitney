### AP Computer Science Principles
- This class received ranking of only 9s and 10s
- "It's Fun" - Kylie Wang
### AP Statistics
- The best math class you will take and very useful
- This high ranking does **NOT** mean the class is easy, you **must** put in the work to succeed
### AP Psychology 
- A great for sophmores as a starter AP class or for seniors looking for a more relaxed class.
- Certain topics could be boring at times but over all is a very interesting class.
### AP Liturature
- Everyone who takes this class loves it, but be aware that becuase it comes *after* AP Language, people who take this class know they like English already
## 5-7/10 - If you're Interested

### AP United States History
- This class is higher rated in the category becuase looking back people are glad that they took it but in the moment, when you are writing that DBQ, it does not feel like it
### AP Calculus AB
- People seem to only *enjoy* this more becuase they are just glad they are not suffering as much as the students in BC
### AP Spanish, Japanese, Chinese
- Really depends on your own level of fluency in the language
- This choice of class should be your own descision as you know your own level in the language
- Lots of writing in preparation for the test 
## 0-4/10 - If you have to I guess...

### AP English Language
- This might just be a personal preference but most classmates enjoyed the fictional aspect of Liturature better than Language
### AP Calculus BC
- I have personally heard nothing but complaints
### AP Chemistry / AP Biology
- This is similar to the AP Foreign Languages as it depends how adept you are at the subject
- The reason it is in a lower tier is becuase if you choose to take it and are not that skilled in it, it takes more work to keep up with the material
## Not enough Information
These are classes that not many people take and I have not taken so I cannot accurately rank them.
### AP Physics
### AP Human Geography
