## 8-10/10 - Highly Recommend
### AP Computer Science Principles
- This class received ranking of only 9s and 10s
- "It's Fun" - Kylie Wang
### AP Statistics
- The best math class you will take and very useful
- This high ranking does **NOT** mean the class is easy, you **must** put in the work to succeed
### AP Psychology 
- A great for sophmores as a starter AP class or for seniors looking for a more relaxed class.
- Certain topics could be boring at times but over all is a very interesting class.
### AP Liturature
- Everyone who takes this class loves it, but be aware that becuase it comes *after* AP Language, people who take this class know they like English already
## 5-7/10 - If you're Interested
## 0-4/10 - If you have to and you do not care about your Sanity
